        time: `2023 - 2024`,
        summary: `Developed a credit risk scoring pipeline combining Home Credit and Lending Club datasets (30M rows). Created 600+ temporal and vintage features capturing payment behavior and denial history. Used Optuna to optimize a Logistic Regression + XGBoost ensemble, improving F1 and KS metrics. Logged experiments with MLflow, deployed the model via Docker and Airflow, and shared SHAP-based explanations through a Looker dashboard.`,

        time: `January 2024 - March 2024`,
        summary: `Built a manga localization pipeline including bubble segmentation (UNet + ResNet-34), Japanese OCR tuning (Tesseract), and translation (Transformer with SentencePiece). Inference speed improved 30% over MarianMT. Used Stable Diffusion for text in-painting with LaTeX overlay. Reduced per-chapter translation time by ~3 hours; adopted by indie publishers for production use.`,

        summary: `Processed 1M ratings from the BX-Books dataset; cleaned and filtered to 200k users and 40k books. Implemented both User-User and Item-Item Collaborative Filtering with cosine similarity via Surprise. Tuned neighborhood size (k=10â€“100); Item-Item with k=60 yielded MAD of 0.74. Analyzed variance with confidence ribbons in Matplotlib. Recommendations were showcased in a Streamlit prototype, complete with book cover fetch via ISBN.`,
